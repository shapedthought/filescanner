# filescanner

First attempt at a method of scanning a filesystem and outputting the relationship between the created date and the days since it was last modified. 

The point of this is to show if a given filesystem is being modified over time or if data is not being modified.

You will need Python as well as the following packages:

pip install folderstats
pip install matplotlib
pip install PySimpleGUI
