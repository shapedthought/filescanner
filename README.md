# filescanner

First attempt at a method of scanning a filesystem and outputting the relationship between the created date and modified date.

The point of this is to show if a given filesystem is being modified over time.

You will need Python as well as the following packages:

- pip install folderstats
- pip install matplotlib
- pip install PySimpleGUI

I recommend running this via Powershell:

python filescanner.py
